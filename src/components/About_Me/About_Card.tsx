      Hey there, welcome to my website! My name is Shreyas. <br />
      <br /> I am a <b>researcher and software developer</b>, eager
      to enable human-like reasoning and better conceptual abstractions using the power of multimodal AI and big data with autonomous agents. I have always enjoyed
      physics/mechanics, but in my first semester at Brown, I{" "}
      <b>
        fell in love with a completely new world of computer science
      </b>
      . <br />
      <br /> During my undergraduate degree, I have cultivated a{" "}
      <b>
        strong passion for programming and artificial intelligence - multimodal AI like computer vision or natural language processing applied with reinforcement learning and deep learning in particular
      </b>
      . Thanks to my courses, I now know <b>Python, Java, MATLAB, Solidity, Go and C</b>{" "}
      and am self-taught in <b>SQL, HTML, Javascript and Typescript</b> :){" "}
      <br /> I had the opportunity to do some interesting projects + research in these areas, check them out below! <br />
      <br /> Aside from this, I was actively involved in{" "}
      <b>Brown's Chess + Table Tennis clubs</b>; I supported the{" "}
      <b>"Brown Space Engineering" (BSE)</b> group with CubeSAT missions,  served as a head teaching assistant and Mieklejohn peer mentor. I also helped students in Providence highschools to accelerate their
      learning. I enjoy working on the seams between the digital/physical worlds
      and want to use multimodal AI to blend the lines between them.{" "}
