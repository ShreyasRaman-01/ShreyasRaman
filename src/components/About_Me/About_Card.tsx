      Hey there! I'm Shreyas, nice to meet you. <br />
      <br /> I am an aspiring <b>ML researcher and software engineer</b>, eager
      to help fundamentally transform people's interaction with technology by
      leveraging the power of AI and data. I have always enjoyed
      physics/mechanics, but in my very first semester at Brown, I{" "}
      <b>
        explored a completely new world (to me) of computer science and fell in
        love
      </b>
      . <br />
      <br /> Over the past 2 years, I have cultivated a{" "}
      <b>
        strong passion for programming and machine learning - computer vision
        and deep learning in particular
      </b>
      . Thanks to my courses, I now "speak" <b>Python, Java, MATLAB and C</b>{" "}
      and I am self-taught in <b>SQL, HTML, Javascript and Typescript</b> :){" "}
      <br /> I have done some interesting projects + research with these; check
      them out below! <br />
      <br /> Aside from this, I am actively involved in{" "}
      <b>Brown's Chess + Table Tennis clubs</b>, I have supported the{" "}
      <b>"Space Engineering"</b> group in some of our recent CubeSAT missions
      and I help students in Providence highschools to accelerate their
      learning. I enjoy being at the seams between the digital/physical worlds
      and want to use ML to revolutionize (and blur) the lines between them.{" "}
