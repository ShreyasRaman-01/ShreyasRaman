I'm Shreyas, nice to meet you. <br/><br/> I am an aspiring <b>ML researcher and software engineer</b>, eager to help fundamentally transform people's interaction with technology by leveraging the power of AI and data. I have always enjoyed physics/mechanics, but in my very first semester at Brown, I <b>explored a completely new world (to me) of computer science and fell in love</b>. <br/><br/> Over the past 2 years, I have cultivated a <b>strong passion for programming and machine learning - computer vision and deep learning in particular</b>. Thanks to my courses, I now "speak" <b>Python, Java, MATLAB and C</b> and I am self-taught in <b>SQL, HTML, Javascript and Typescript</b> :)  <br/> I have done some interesting projects + research with these; check them out below! <br/><br/> Aside from this, I am actively involved in <b>Brown's Chess + Table Tennis clubs</b>, I have supported the <b>"Space Engineering"</b> group in some of our recent CubeSAT missions and I help students in Providence highschools to accelerate their learning. I enjoy being at the seams between the digital/physical worlds and want to use ML to revolutionize (and blur) the lines between them. </p>
